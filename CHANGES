Changelog
=========

2.x.x
-------

- ``yuicompressor`` does not require setuptools anymore: it's also installable
  with pure distutils. However, the executable script in the pure distutils
  installation does not have the same name as in the setuptools installation:
  it is named ``yuicompressor_run.py`` instead of ``yuicompressor`` due to
  import restriction and windows shebang incompatibility.
- Added a ``run`` method in the ``yuicompressor`` module allowing us to run
  the tool with custom arguments from python source code.
- Added a changelog (CHANGES file)
- Added maintainer information
- Linux-style end-of-line characters
